# fuchsia-git-helper README

Simple extension for quick-opening fuchsia.git files in OSS Code Search (or, optionally, Gitiles).

## How to use:

Right click inside the text editor or on a file/folder in the explorer pane,
then select "Open in OSS Code Search".
Or, use the command palette and select "Open in OSS Code Search".

You can toggle a setting to use Gitiles instead of OSS Code Search if you prefer.

Note: By default, it assumes the root of your workspace is also the root of fuchsia.git. If
this isn't true, you should set the "Fuchsia Root" setting to the absolute path to your fuchsia.git
root.
