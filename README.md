# fuchsia-git-helper README

Simple extension for quick-opening fuchsia.git files in Gitiles.

## How to use:

Right click inside the text editor or on file/folder in the explorer pane,
then select "Open in Gitiles".
Or, use the command palette and select "Open in Gitiles".

Note: this assumes the root of your workspace is also the root of fuchsia.git,
and opening links will break if this assumption doesn't hold.
